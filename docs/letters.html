    <p>My love,

I don’t know how to explain what you do to me.
Sometimes, I try to put it into words, and every word feels too small.

Before you, life was just… life. It was routine, quiet, safe, and empty in places I didn’t even realize were hollow.
Then you came into my world like sunlight pours into a closed room — gentle, slow, and suddenly everything became warm.

I love the way you feel things deeply.
I love the way you care, even when you say you're tired.
I love when you get emotional and try to hide it — because I see it.
I always see you.

When you laugh, I want to keep the sound.
When you cry, I want to hold the pieces with my hands.
When you dream, I want to build that dream brick by brick with you.

I know you've been strong for too long.
With me, you don’t have to be.

You can rest.
You can lean.
You can be your softest self.

I’ll hold this love gently.
I’ll hold you gently.

Not just today.
Not just now.
But in every lifetime, in every tomorrow that comes, in every slow evening and fast morning and quiet moment when the world disappears and it’s just us.

I’m here.
I’m not leaving.
I don’t know how not to love you anymore.

Your forever,
Him</p>
